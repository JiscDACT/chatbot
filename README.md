# Chatbot Innovation Project

This chatbot innovation project is using Amazon Lex as the AI Chatbot engine, information store will use either postgresql through Amazon RDS or DynamoDB and the deployment plan is to use Microsoft Teams (longer term use REACT JS for the user interface). You can embed the chatbot onto a website using html.

dynamodb uses [boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) library to connect to AWS

You need to use IAM AWS service to setup user permissions and for Key/password etc
